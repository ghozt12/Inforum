# Inforum

This is a Deco3500 project.

Inforum, a social mobile application, aims to host an online community which operates for the purpose of generating an “organic news stream” - disassociated with commercialised content.

# How its built

Inforum uses the following technology
- ReactJs
- React Router Component
- React Router Component Transition
- React slider
- Compass and SASS
- NPM build file

### What is React you might ask
A JavaScript library for building useful interfaces, created by Facebook. 

### What is SASS asketh you
SASS, or Sassy CSS is pretty much CSS with some added benifits. The problem with this is that you need to compile SASS into CSS before you can attach it to a HTML page, which is why we are using Compass. 

### What is Compass you ask
We use Compass in the command line to compile the SASS files automatically into CSS as we w rite them.

# How to install all of this

### Mac
Assuming you are on a glorious Mac, you will need to do the following

1) Download and Install Node.js 
https://nodejs.org/en/

2) Open Terminal.

3) Install NPM
sudo npm install npm -g

What that ^ means:
sudo means install as a super user (ie as Admin)
npm is opening Node.js 
'install npm' installs the package manager
-g install the package globally so you can access it whever you want (on your computer)

4) Go make a folder for this project
5) in Terminal type: git clone https://github.com/ghozt12/Inforum.git
6) in Terminal, CD into Inforum
7) in Terminal type: npm install

You are done, everything is ready to roll.

### Windows
Ahh, a dirty Windows user. 

# How to run all of this 
### Mac

in Terminal type: Compass watch
leave it running ^

You can now change the SASS files

if you are Editing the React files run
npm start
and leave it running, it will automatically compile React into js/bundle.js

### Windows
ahh...
